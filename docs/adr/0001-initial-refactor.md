# [ADR-0001] Establish Architecture Documentation and ADR Process

- Status: Accepted
- Deciders: Core Team
- Date: 2025-01-12

## Context

The project lacked formal architecture documentation and a process for recording decisions,
complicating maintenance and future refactors.

## Decision

Create dedicated architecture docs under `docs/architecture` with diagrams and adopt an
Architecture Decision Record (ADR) process stored in `docs/adr`.

## Consequences

Team members can reference diagrams for system understanding and use the ADR template for
future decisions, improving traceability of refactors.
