## Redaction Policy

Logs should never include secrets or personally identifiable information. Replace sensitive fields such as API keys, tokens, email addresses, or user identifiers with `[REDACTED]`. When logging structured data, include only the fields necessary for debugging. If unsure whether data is sensitive, omit it.
